## Contributing with the database

**Colaboradados** is a community driven and non-profit organization. In order to collaborate with the database you'll have to go inside `colaboradados.github.io/_posts` and choose whatever file you want to add your contribution. All the files are in `Markdown` format and you may use wichever text editor you prefer. The files **must be** edited using the same pattern for lists, titles and alphabetical order, this will make the work more concise and helps the [**@colabora_bot**](https://twitter.com/colabora_bot) functioning. If you have questions, feel free to contact us.
